  '# Lash Out Loud! Your Ultimate Guide to Lash Extensions

Hey Lash Babes! Angie here from Glamours Beauty Salon in Newark, NJ! Thinking about lash extensions but feeling lost? Don''t sweat it, I got you! Here''s the super-condensed, no-fluff version to get you started.

## 1. Lash Types - Think of it like fabric!

- **Mink/Sable**: Soft & natural, but pricier. Like cashmere for your eyes!
- **Silk**: Popular, good balance of price & look. Like a comfy, cute sweater.
- **Synthetic**: Budget-friendly, can be a bit thicker. Like a fun, trendy top.

We''ll help you pick the best fabric for YOU at Glamours!

## 2. Lash Styles - What''s your vibe?

- **Classic**: Natural boost, one extension per lash. "I woke up like this" vibes.
- **Volume**: Full & fluffy, multiple extensions per lash. Hello, drama!
- **Hybrid**: Mix of both! "I woke up kinda like this, but prettier!"
- **Cat Eye/Doll Eye**: Shapes to emphasize your eyes!

We''ll customize the look to MATCH your personality!

## 3. Curls & Lengths - How much "oomph" do you want?

- **Curls**: From barely there to "wowza!" (We''ll find the perfect curve!)
- **Lengths**: Longer = bolder. (But we''ll keep your lashes healthy, promise!)

## 4. Aftercare - Don''t be a lash wrecker!

- No oil-based makeup near your lashes!
- Clean them gently!
- Brush ''em! (We''ll give you a brush!)
- Don''t rub your eyes!
- Get fills every 2-3 weeks to keep them looking bomb!

That''s it! Ready to ditch the mascara and wake up gorgeous?
